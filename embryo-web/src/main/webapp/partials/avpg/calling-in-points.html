        <span>Note the IMO-adopted ship reporting systems GREENPOS and COASTAL CONTROL.<br/><br/>
            The GREENPOS system is mandatory for all ships sailing to or from Greenland waters within the Greenland continental shelf or EEZ.
            <br/>GREENPOS reports must be sent to the Joint Arctic Command (AKO), if necessary via Aasiaat Radio.
            <br/><br/>COASTAL CONTROL reports apply to any ship of 20 GT or more and fishing vessels sailing between Greenland ports and landing sites. These vessels must submit COASTAL CONTROL reports to Aasiaat Radio.<br/><br/>AKO encourages ships navigating the Atlantic Ocean within the Greenland EEZ, including cruise ships and research vessels, to remain in the GREENPOS system during their entire voyage.<br/><br/>Based on the reports received, AKO and Aasiaat Radio will keep track of the position in Greenland waters of ships participating in the reporting system, so that a search and rescue operation can be established at any given time.

        The website also features information on the radio reporting service AMVER, which is administered by the
        U.S. Coast Guard and is open to all ships in the Atlantic Ocean.

        The Joint Arctic Command (AKO) collects and distributes information about the buoyage along the Greenland coast.
        The maritime traffic is very dependent on the reports submitted by mariners regarding extinguished lights,
        damaged or missing beacons and sightings of unknown reefs in the surveyed waters. Such messages can be called in
        by telephone directly to AKO or through the police, municipal officers and Aasiaat Radio.
