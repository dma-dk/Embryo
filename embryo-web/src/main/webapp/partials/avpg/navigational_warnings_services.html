        <p><span>TELE Greenland maintains an emergency and safety watch on shipping in Greenland waters. TELE Greenland also attends to vessels&rsquo;
            requirement for commercial communication by radio (VHF, MF and HF).<br/><br/>The options for vessels to obtain information about the weather and ice conditions and any hazards to navigation in Greenland waters are discussed below:</span>

        <p><span>Meteorological notices</span><span><br/>Weather forecasts, marine forecasts and any gale and storm warnings and warnings of ice accretion are issued by Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa (KNR). Aasiaat Radio rebroadcasts sea forecasts produced by KNR on the VHF work channels. These weather forecasts are only in Greenlandic and Danish. Gale and storm warnings and warnings about ice accretion are also broadcast on Aasiaat Radio on MF and VHF in English, Greenlandic and Danish.</span>

        <p><span>Information from the DMI Ice Service and Ice Patrol can be considered as indicative for the ships&rsquo;
            masters.</span></p>

        <p><span>Ice Patrol Narsarsuaq is staffed with navigators throughout the year and has a helicopter at its disposal for offshore ice reconnaissance. Reconnaissance is generally performed 2-3 times per week, and a separate assessment is made for which area each reconnaissance will cover. The outer limits for ice reconnaissance are usually Paamiut (Frederiksh&aring;b) and Ikerasassuaq (Prins Christian Sund). The DMI Ice Service is staffed with specially trained personnel for the analysis of satellite data for ice information.</span>

            information<br/></strong></span></span></span><span>Joint Arctic Command (AKO) issues navigation information as required, in cooperation with Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa (KNR) and Aasiaat Radio.<br/>The navigation information broadcast over KNR is read out in Danish and Greenlandic so that mariners can get updates on changes to buoyage or warnings about newly discovered dangers to navigation.<br/>Maritime safety information is broadcast by Aasiaat Radio in Danish and English.<br/><br/>The Joint Arctic Command (AKO) collects and distributes information about the buoyage along the Greenland coast.<br/>The maritime traffic is very dependent on the reports submitted by mariners regarding extinguished lights, damaged or missing beacons and sightings of unknown reefs in the surveyed waters. Such messages can be called in by telephone directly to AKO or through the police, municipal officers and Aasiaat Radio.</span>
        </p>

        <p>For further information on the issuing of maritime safety information, see the annex to Notices to Mariners

        <p>NAVTEX<br/>Many areas of the world, including Greenland, use the international system, NAVTEX, for
            broadcasting important and vital information to the maritime traffic. The NAVTEX system is part of the
            Global Maritime Distress and Safety System, GMDSS, and must be available on all cargo ships in international
            trade, on all passenger ships and on the largest fishing vessels.</p>

        <p>Greenland waters are covered by 2 transmitters located in Iceland at Grindavik and Saudarnes (East Greenland)
            and 3 transmitters located at Simiutaq, Nuuk, and Upernavik respectively (West Greenland).<br/>The
            broadcasts are operated remotely from the Joint Arctic Command (AKO). It is therefore the Maritime Rescue
            Coordinator Centre Nuuk (MRCC Nuuk) that edits and transmits the safety messages via NAVTEX.</p>

        <p>For details on the NAVTEX system&rsquo;s categories of messages and broadcast hours and areas, see the annex
            to Notices to Mariners (EfS), <a
                    href="http://www.soefartsstyrelsen.dk/SikkerhedTilSoes/Sejladsinformation/EfS/Sider/EfSArkiv.aspx"
                    target="_blank">EfS A</a><span>, on the website of the Danish Maritime Authority.</span></p>

        <p>Broadcast hours and areas are also listed in the radio handbooks, for example UKHO NP285, Admiralty List of
            Radio Signals, Volume 5 - Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS).</p>

        <p>Navigational warnings<br/>Messages of importance to the safety at sea which cannot be published in Notices to
            Mariners (EfS) with sufficient notice, are broadcast by Aasiaat Radio as Navigational warnings. The coastal
            radio stations broadcast the notifications by radio telephony in both Danish and English. They are prepared
            by the Joint Arctic Command (AKO) in Nuuk.</p>

        <p>For details about the structure of the messages, broadcasting stations, frequencies, broadcast hours and
            period of transmission, see the annex to Notices to Mariners (EfS), <a
