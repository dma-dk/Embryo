        <p>
            All satellite images cover an area of the Arctic region. The area is revealed by their names (e.g. r01c01).
            Satellites are not always able to obtain image data for the desired area and the satellite images may as a
            consequence become smaller than the area or show no image at all.
        </p>

        <p>
            Satellite images are served as image tiles. A new set of image tiles may be fetched for each zoom level.
            The downloaded amount of image tiles and thus internet connection usage therefore depends on the map usage
            (zooming and panning), while the satellite
            image is displayed.
